# To-Do List Webpage - JavaScript Project

This is a simple To-Do List webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks from their to-do list. Below, you'll find a brief description of the project's structure and functionality.

## Project Structure
The project consists of three main files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js`. Here's a breakdown of their roles:

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that defines the structure of the webpage. It includes the input field for adding tasks, a list to display tasks, and buttons for completing and deleting tasks.

- **style.css**: The CSS file provides styling for the webpage, making it visually appealing. It defines the layout, fonts, colors, and button styles.

- **index.js**: The JavaScript file contains the functionality of the To-Do List. It handles user interactions, such as adding, completing, and deleting tasks. The code listens for events and manipulates the DOM based on user actions.

## Webpage Features
1. **Add a New Task**: Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the to-do list.

2. **Complete a Task**: Clicking the "Complete" button next to a task toggles a line-through style on that task, indicating it's completed.

3. **Delete a Task**: Clicking the "Delete" button removes the task from the list.

4. **Styling**: The webpage is styled with a pleasant background, fonts, and buttons, making it user-friendly.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to access the To-Do List webpage.
2. Enter tasks in the input field and click "Add" to add them to your list.
3. Mark tasks as completed by clicking the "Complete" button.
4. Delete tasks by clicking the "Delete" button.

## How It Works
The JavaScript code in `index.js` listens for events such as clicks on the "Add," "Complete," and "Delete" buttons. It dynamically adds and updates tasks in the list, handles completion, and removes tasks when deleted. 

The styling is achieved using the CSS defined in `style.css`, providing an attractive and user-friendly interface.

This project is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to build a simple to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can further enhance and customize the functionality and design to suit your needs.

Enjoy using your To-Do List Webpage!
